### About me
Hi! I'm currently (09/12/2021) a post-graduate researcher at the University of Nottingham working on adaptive sampling with nanopore sequencing. I'm interested in all sorts of Bioinformatics, visualisations and fun side projects ( Some of which I even complete ).

    - [minoTour](https://github.com/LooseLab/minotourapp) - real-time monitoring of nanopore sequencers
